# Introduction
Hi and welcome!
This is my first blog posted on my website. This website has been a long time coming. I have built it as a place where I can personally brand myself. If you would like to reach out, hit the contact button so we can chat! 
This website was specifically built using Gatsby, React, Tailwind and deployed with Netlify. I do have prior experience with vue.js, however I wanted to give React a try to see the similarities and differences.

# My Exchange Experience
I have already detailed parts of my exchange experience on my travel blog website which can be found here [Travel Blog](https://jezdufourq.github.io/). To give you the TLDR; I went to Germany for roughly 10 months to study and work. 

My experience started in Karlsruhe, Baden WÃ¼rttemberg. Karlsruhe is considered an industrial city, and is home to many great engineering institutions including KIT )(Karlsruhe Institute of Technology) and HsKA (Karlsruhe University of Applied Sciences).

I studied my exchange semester as HsKA taking a mixture of classes including A1.2 German, Machine Learning and Macro Economics. These classes complimented the studies which I was already currently doing in Australia at QUT.

Throughout my time as an exchange student in Germany I managed to do ALOT of travel. From countries in south east Europe, like Slovenia, to revisiting relatives in Scotland and England, and to spending time with Friends and Family in Canada and then tracking down to New York. It was an extremely rewarding experience to see so many cultures in such a short period of time. I also was able to visit the Oktoberfest in Munich, Karneval in Cologne, and the Weihnachtsmacht (Christmas markets) in Karlsruhe and Heidelberg, which was an experience in itself.

After finishing my exchange semester in late Jan, 2020, it was time to start my internship at SAP in Walldorf, Germany. So I packed up my bags, and moved 1 hour north of Karlsruhe to Heidelberg. Heidelberg, in my opinion, was the most beautiful city I visited in Germany. It is situated half an hour east of Mannheim, and 1 hour north of Karlsruhe, on the banks of the Necker river. It is a university city, being home to the oldest university in Germany. It was great to live with a diverse range of students/professionals in Heidelberg, and the student culture there was amazing.

My internship at SAP consisted of working on a web application with a tech stack of vue.js, java, HANA (database) and hosted on SAP's Cloud Platform NEO. It was an extremely rewarding experience learning and managing the platforms development. If you would like more information on my experience here, please contact me.

Unfortunately, like most things in 2020, the trip was ended short due to Covid-19. However, I am extremely grateful to have spent 10 months in Europe, studying, travelling and working. Germany is definitely a place I would return to live again.

To all the friends/family I met and reconnected with over in Europe, thank-you for the memories which we shared.
