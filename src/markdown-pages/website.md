This website was built using the following tech:

* Gatsby - [Link here](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/)
* React - [Link here](https://reactjs.org/)
* TailwindCss - [Link here](https://tailwindcss.com/)
* Netlify (for deployment) - [Linkhere](https://www.netlify.com/)

The purpose of using the tech above was so that I could learn React. It also has another added
purpose with Gatsby being very extensible for templating ang
blogging. This is the direction where I want to take this website
after the first version has been posted.
